# What is python-images-compressor?

It is an image compressor w/ Pillow which recursivelly compresses all the images in a given folder.

## How can I execute the compressor?

Open your terminal and write:

```shell
python3 compressor.py images_dir quality scale_factor should_replace

  1. type(images_dir) = string
  2. type(quality) = number
  3. type(scale_factor) = number
  4. type(should_replace) = bool
```

- Note: the compressor will only work for _.jpg_, _.jpeg_ and _.png_ files.
